  description: "In Greek Mythology, Elpis is the personification of the aspect of
    hope. \r\nWhen Pandora opened her box and released all forms of misery and sickness
    on mankind, one aspect remains behind \u2013 hope. \r\nIn Greek arts, Elpis is
    usually depicted carrying flowers and a cornucopia, which may have served as
    her symbol."
