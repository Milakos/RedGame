  description: The anchor is a very ancient symbol of hope because of its function.
    Normally made of metal and connected to a rope or chain,  an anchor is what holds
    a ship in place by digging into the bed of the water under the ship. It prevents
    the ship from drifting, which would naturally occur due to wind or current.
