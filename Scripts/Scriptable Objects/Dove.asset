  description: "A common figure of hope is the dove, originating from the story of
    Noah in the Bible. \r\nIn the story, Noah spends forty days and forty nights
    on a boat in the middle of a huge flood. \r\nAfter he lands on a mountain, he
    sends a dove out to scout for dry land. \r\nSeveral days later, the dove comes
    back holding an olive branch."
